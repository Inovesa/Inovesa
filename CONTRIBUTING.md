Thank you for considering contributing to Inovesa.
We open-sourced it in the hope that it will be most useful that way.

# Contributing to Inovesa
## Reporting a bug
Bugs are reported using the
[Inovesa issue tracker at GitHub](https://github.com/Inovesa/Inovesa/issues).
Please check, whether the bug has already been reported.

## Fixing a bug
If the bug is small, please just open a pull request,
else, please, report the bug first.

## Suggesting a feature or enhancement
Features or enhancement can be requested using the
[Inovesa issue tracker at GitHub](https://github.com/Inovesa/Inovesa/issues).
Please check, whether there is already a corresponding feature request.
If you like to suggest a feature to check a new (and unpublished) theory,
feel free to directly contact [the maintainer](CONTRIBUTORS.md#maintainer).

## Implementing a feature
Before starting, it is a good idea to talk about the implementation.
(See also
[Suggesting a feature or enhancement](#suggesting-a-feature-or-enhancement).)
If you plan to publish about the new feature
and may not discuss the feature publicly prior publication,
feel free to contact [the maintainer](CONTRIBUTORS.md#maintainer).
Note: One month of coding can save you one day of propper planning.

## Documentation
*   For every task or feature, there should be at least one
    small HOWTO describing a (the intended) way to use it.
    If you miss something, please ask.
    Users are also welcomed to write their own HOWTOs and tutorials
    (we will probably link them).
*   Abstract functionality can be documented,
    but it is also possible to just refer to scientific publications.
*   Implementation details should be documeted in the code,
    either explicitly or by ticking to the programming guidelines.
    (At the moment, the latter are not named explicitly.
    This is subject to be improved in a future release of this document.)
