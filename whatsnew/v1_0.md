# Inovesa 1.0

## Inovesa 1.0.0: Gamma

### Features
*    Traditional rotation can now performed off-center

### IO
*    Build options are printed to result files
*    fftw wisdom files are now saved at $XDG_DATA_HOME
*    Added option "--run_anyway" to allow running without any output.
*    Improved log output
*    Introduced program option "--buildinfo" as verbose alternative to "--version"

### Performance
*   Improved zero padding
*   The OpenCL command queue can now be properly used for proper profiling

### Fixes
*    Integer overflow could happen in output PNG
*    Program segfaulted when reading broken HDF5
*    Improved building process
*    Fixed "butterfly effect" that changed results depending on GUI on/off

### Misc
*    Due to stability issues, FFT using OpenCL is currently turned off in CMake. This will bring a mayor performance regression on graphic cards.
