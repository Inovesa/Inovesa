# Inovesa 1.1

## Inovesa 1.1.0: Noisy and non-linear

### Features
*   Add option for nonlinear optics and RF
*   Add option to simulate RF noise

### IO
*   Consider effective instead of nominal voltage
*   Average energy is now saved to HDF5
*   Improved information printing
*   Improved passive particle tracking
    *   Particle positions are now displayed in GUI
    *   Positions are now saved and read in in q/p coordinates (instead of x/y ones)
    *   Added (linear) interpolation to passive particle tracking
*   Added command line option "StepsPerRevolution" (overwrites "StepsPerTs" if set)
*   Build can now controlled more granularly even if dependencies are fulfilled:
    *   Environment variable INOVESA_USE_OPENCL=0 deactivates OpenCL
    *   Environment variable INOVESA_USE_OPENGL=0 deactivates OpenGL

### Fixes
*   Improved compatibility with current OpenCL

### Misc
*   Improved code quality
*   On some platforms, OpenCL (esp. when using clFFT) is unstable. Thus the default OpenCL device is set to 0 (= turned off).
*   Unit testing for most features was done manually. CI was started later in the development process. Thus, unit tests are unavailable for this release.
